This is going to be a project builder automation tool. ie. building
pre-requisites, I have working code that does this already but i plan to 
extend it more, it sorts out dependencies already. 


Use:
# ./shovel

Or:

# python setup.py bdist_egg
# easy_install {eggname}

Then use it from the command line

# shovel

Then see:
# Examples/Mosaic/dirt 

for how the build files look
