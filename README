This is going to be a project builder automation tool. ie. building
pre-requisites, I have working code that does this already but i plan to 
extend it more, it sorts out dependencies already. 


Use:
# ./shovel

or:

# python setup.py bdist_egg
# easy_install {eggname}

then use it from the command line

# shovel
